# Result-Summary-Frontend-Mentor
This is my solution to the "Result summary component" from Frontend Mentor using Hyper Text Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets.
The webiste is responsive and it uses flexbox to achive that.
If you find a problem or a thing you think can be better, text me.
Thanks!
